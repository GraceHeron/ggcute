A meme built upon the super cute ggcute package. 

## Installation

You can install the original ggcute from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("sharlagelfand/ggcute")
```

## \#Girlboss Alert

I want to get better at R coding so this is just for funsies. I am a ggcute stan so I started with modifying Sharla's code for a different colour palette. I wanted something to rhyme with fairyfloss so naturally this gave creation to the girlboss theme `r emo::ji("girls")`. A quick google search of the term 'girlboss colour scheme' gave me a pinterest colour board that I copied (I have no original thoughts).

```{r}
show_col(ggcute:::girlboss_colours)
```

Ta da! I had fun!

```{r}
ggplot(nintendo_sales, aes(x = sales_type, y = sales_million, colour = console)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 5, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_colour_girlboss() +
  theme_girlboss(base_size = 12) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
```
